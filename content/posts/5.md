October 2024 marked the end of Microsoft's x86 support for Windows 7 ESU updates. Only x64 systems receive continued security patches.

## Current ESU Status (July 2025)

- **Latest x64 Cumulative:** KB5062632
- **Final x86 Cumulative:** KB5044356 (October 2024)
- **.NET Framework 4.8:** Requires valid ESU license
- **Root Certificates:** Continuous updates required

## The Reality Check

Organizations still running Windows 7 must plan migration strategies as ESU support narrows to x64-only systems with expensive licensing requirements.

The writing is on the wall - Windows 7's extended support is becoming increasingly limited and costly, making migration planning more critical than ever for enterprise environments.
