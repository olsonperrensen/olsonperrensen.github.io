Installing Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) after Windows 7 SP1 reveals a complex web of dependencies. The Convenience Rollup (SP2) updates don't apply correctly when AD LDS is added post-installation.

## The Problem

12 different AD LDS-related updates exist, but only 6 are actually required:

- **KB975541** - Core AD LDS Feature
- **KB2462137** - Country Display Fix
- **KB2539513** - Repadmin Query Fix
- **KB2589154** - MMC RODC Crash Fix
- **KB2647644** - Certificate Security Identity
- **KB3012660** - Security Update Replacement

## Analysis Result

Half the available updates are superseded by others, creating unnecessary complexity for system administrators.

Understanding these dependencies is crucial for environments that require AD LDS functionality while maintaining proper security patch coverage.
