Before applying any ESU patches to a clean Windows 7 installation, two critical prerequisites must be installed:

## KB4474419 - SHA-2 Code Signing Support

Microsoft transitioned from SHA-1 to SHA-2 hash algorithms for update verification. Without this update, newer patches simply won't install due to signature validation failures.

## KB4490628 - March 2019 Servicing Stack Update

The servicing stack is the component responsible for installing Windows updates. This SSU ensures your system can reliably receive and process Microsoft updates.

## Pro Tip

Always reboot between these prerequisite updates and subsequent patches to avoid installation conflicts.

These foundational updates are absolutely essential for any Windows 7 system that needs to receive modern security patches through the ESU program.
